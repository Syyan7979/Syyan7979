- 👋 Hi, I’m @Syyan7979
- 👀 I’m interested in Software Design and Development, particularly in the field of Web, Mobile, and Game Development. I'm also quite interested in Computer Security and Machine Learning, although I am less adept on these fields compared to the former mentioned.
- 🌱 I’m currently making projects making use of either the MEAN or MERN tech stack for Web and Mobile Development (making use of React Native rather instead of vanilla React).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything as long as I can learn something new.
- 📫 You can reach me at: kurtisrael999@gmail.com
